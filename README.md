### An analytical approximation to measure the extinction cross-section using: Localized Waves
-Journal of Physics Communications 6 015003(2022).

We present a general expression for the optical theorem in terms of Localized Waves. This representation is well-known and commonly used to generate Frozen waves, Xwaves, and other propagation invariant beams. We analyze several examples using different input beam sources on a circular detector to measure the extinction cross-section.
